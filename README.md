Python program to process Whatsapp chat exports and produce chat statistics

To use it, export a whatsapp chat history (without media) and place the chat in the same folder as the python script, then run the python script and when prompted input the name of the .txt file (e.g. "WhatsAppChat1.txt").

It's recommended that you rename the file to a single word without spaces. E.g. "chat.txt"

If you place it in a subdirectory makes sure you've added the subdirectory name e.g. "Samples/WhatsappChat.txt" if it's in a subdirector called "Samples"

Also, matplotlib and python 3.x are required, though the matplotlib parts can be easily commented out if you don't want to see the accompanying graphs
